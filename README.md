# About my portfolio
**Looking for the portfolio itself? [Right this way.](https://stevenwoodrum.github.io/)**

Hosting a personal portfolio on GitHub is a free opportunity to practice basic web development and showcase my work - a project about projects.

Special thanks to:
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework for simple, responsive webpages
- The Internet and a shaky camera hand for everything else you see
- Family and friends for rejecting the horrible layouts you don't see.

From my experience, there are a few minor downsides to using GitHub Pages as a host. Note that I'm not a trained web dev; there may be workarounds.
- Only simple, static technologies are supported. No AJAX, PHP, etc.
- Source must be publicly visible. Fine by me, and the price is right.
