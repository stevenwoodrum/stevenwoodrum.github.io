#About portfolio
*Looking for the porfolio itself?  [Right this way](http://stevenwoodrum.github.io).*

##Why GitHub?
> "GitHub is how people build software." - from *About GitHub*

> "GitHub is for software.  Why is this your portfolio?" *- you, probably*

> "You can quote me on this." *- me*

Here's why I'm not afraid to try something different:

###1. Free
Need I say more?
###2. Accessible
(all audiences)
###3. Simple...
GitHub's repository structure makes publishing easy.  Project pages may be rapidly assembled using the built-in Markdown language.
###4. ...but complex
(customize, no restriction)
###5. It teaches me
(web design, myself)

##Technologies
* HTML/CSS
* JavaScript
