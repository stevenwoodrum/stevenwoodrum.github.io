<h1>Combat Robotics</h1>
</div>

<p class="lead">
I design, build, and compete fighting robots - remote control or autonomous machines that battle each other in an enclosed arena.
It's no surprise that the sport historically emphasizes mechanical design over electronics. Onboard electrical and computer systems are often primitive;
their contribution relies on external innovation from companies producing stronger motors, bigger batteries, tougher connectors, etc.
With an educational background in computer engineering, I challenge myself to develop robust electronic systems that not only support, but enhance mechanical functionality.
I'm excited to explore a new perspective on combat robots, designing them as more tightly integrated electro-mechanical systems.
Featured below are a few bots I've contributed to. New robots are in development!
</p>

<h2>Sabre-X</h2>
<p><b>Weight:</b> 220 lbs</p>
<p><b>Team:</b> Cavalier Combots</p>
<p><b>Record:</b> 3W/2L (RoboGames 2017)</p>
<p>
Spurred by success and a growing team of university students, 120-lb Sabre was reborn as Sabre-X, a 220-lb heavyweight.
In addition to a scaled version of the trademark 3-tooth disk weapon, Sabre-X debuted a prototype hinged, spring-damped weapon gantry to soften attacks from infamous vertical drum spinners.
In practice, vertical attacks still warped the aluminum assembly, but the concept holds theoretical promise for future builders.
By the way, Sabre-X's weapon is terrifying. The team opted for a mid-tier motor... it still spins the 45 lb belt-driven disk up to 2200 RPM in less than 5 seconds.
</p>
<p>
Sabre-X features a 4 wheel independent drive, sacrificing weight and internal space for intentional redundancy and increased traction.
Signal mixing was incorporated and provided much better driver control compared to a previous twin-stick configuration.
4WD was an appropriate design choice given the limited time and expertise available for the 2016-17 season, but I hope to expand this feature and explore other ways to improve drive performance.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, I spruced up Sabre-X with strip LEDs. Beautiful and functional, they serve as power indicators for safety.
I'm pleased to say not a single one broke.

<h2>Sabre</h2>
<p><b>Weight:</b> 120 lbs</p>
<p><b>Team:</b> Cavalier Combots</p>
<p><b>Record:</b> 4th place - W?/2L (RoboGames 2016)</p>
<p>
Sabre was a 120 pound robot built to compete at the <a href="http://robogames.net/index.php">RoboGames</a> 2016 international competition.
It was a remarkable creation, built by a newly formed team of graduate and undergraduate students at the University of Virginia, and was my first hands-on experience with combat robotics.
In April 2016, many were surprised to see this small, vicious, unknown competitor earn 4th place in its weight class.
A 3-toothed high-RPM steel disk rips through opponents' armor. Its favorite meal is rubber tires.
Two motors each drive a pair of chain-connected wheels and zip Sabre around the arena at startling speeds.
